## Desktop Wallpaper Project

The lovely folks over at [The Fox is Black][thefoxisblack] have been releasing a treasure trove of awesome desktop designs as a part of the Desktop Wallpaper Project. I found the webpage to be a little slow to load and there is unfortunately no way to download all backgrounds as a bundle. I wrote this little script to grab all the background in 1400x900.

### My Fork

I added some features I missed i.e. downloading only new wallpapers, and some prettier prints.
